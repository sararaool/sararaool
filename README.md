üöÄ About Me
I'm a passionate Data Science graduate with a stellar 9.73/10.00 CGPA who loves transforming complex datasets into compelling stories and actionable insights. My journey from B.Sc. Information Technology to M.Sc. Data Science reflects my evolution into a Data Storyteller who thrives on uncovering patterns hidden within numbers.

üî≠ I'm currently working on Advanced Analytics Projects and Dashboard Development
üå± I'm currently learning Machine Learning algorithms and Advanced SQL techniques
üëØ I'm looking to collaborate on Data Science Projects and Business Analytics
üí¨ Ask me about Data Analysis, Python, Tableau, SQL, and Problem Solving
üéØ Goal: To become a Data Analyst at Google and make meaningful impact through data-driven insights
‚ö° Fun fact: I enjoy Googling solutions (quite fitting for my career aspirations!), Yoga for mental clarity, and Trekking to explore new places (much like exploring datasets!)
ü§ù Open to: Collaborative projects, and meaningful discussions about data science and its real-world applications
